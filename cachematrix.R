## This is part of assignment 2 in the R
## programming course. More details needed.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## !!! Not yet clear what this function should do !!!
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve takes a matrix as an argument and
## checks if its inverse is cached. If yes, it returns
## the cached inverse matrix, otherwise it computes the
## inverse, saves it in the cache and returns the inversed
## matrix.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
